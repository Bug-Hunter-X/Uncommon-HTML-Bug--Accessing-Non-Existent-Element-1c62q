This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in HTML: accessing a DOM element before it exists.  The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code that attempts to interact with an element before the browser has finished rendering it. The solution is provided in `solution.html`, demonstrating the correct way to handle such situations. The primary lesson is that script execution should be delayed until the entire DOM is ready using the DOMContentLoaded event. This ensures that there are no unexpected behaviors.
